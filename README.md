An experimental programming language for ergonomic software verification using [Hoare Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic).


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Ika currently uses `cargo` for builds and running tests and git submodules for dependency management.

Installation instructions can be found at https://rustup.rs/
Non-rust dependencies can be installed via `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

### Building

Building requires a single step,
```
```
cargo build
```

This allows us to run our prototype parser.

```
./target/debug/ika <file>
```

## Running the tests

Running the tests should also be fairly simple, but relies on some dependencies which we will fetch using git.

```
cargo test
```

## Installation

ika is a standalone single file. It can be installed simply by building and copy/moving ./ika into your /usr/bin directory.
